                <h2>Book Database Website</h2>
                <p>
                    A mock website that integrates a backend database
                    written in SQL. The website features an account system
                    with a username and password aswell as a recommendation
                    system for each account and a follow system where you 
                    can follow other users and see their books. Additionally,
                    each user can have multibple "cupboards" where they can 
                    display and rate any book from the database.

                    TD;LR I worked with 4 other students on this semester 
                    long project where we completely planned and designed a 
                    SQL database and a website to feature the different 
                    books.

                <p>
                    A website created to teach the TCP process in an
                    interactive learning environment. I spearheaded this
                    project with 3 other like minded individuals during
                    a hackathon heald at RIT. During this project, not only
                    did I overcome sleep, but I also learned how to effectively
                    work in a team and the importance of planning a project 
                    before starting.

                <h2>Slime Platformer</h2>
                <p>
                    A platformer game created using the godot game engine
                    with scripts written in godot's python inspired
                    language. Besides basic game, level, and art design, 
                    I also learned to overcome a multitude of scripting
                    problems. This was a passion project of mine.
                    Where I completely created a game, from it's art to the 
                    programing behind it.

                <p>
                    A personal project to try out the different tools in
                    Java's Robot Library. It gave me the chance to figure out
                    how to make applications run faster in different
                    scenarios by using threads and optimizing code for 
                    each benchmark.

                    based off of previous gpa and current grades based on
                    RIT standards.

                    that have control over your computer and find any
                    issues and solve problems like how to start/stop the
                    application without it being focused.
