                        A mock website that integrates a backend database
                        written in SQL. The website features an account system
                        with a username and password aswell as a recommendation
                        system for each account and a follow system where you 
                        can follow other users and see their books. Additionally,
                        each user can have multiple "cupboards" where they can 
                        display and rate any book from the database.

                        I worked with 4 other students on this semester 
                        long project where we completely planned and designed a 
                        SQL database and a website to feature the different 
                        books.

                        A website created to teach the TCP process in an
                        interactive learning environment. I spearheaded this
                        project with 3 other like minded individuals during
                        a hackathon heald at RIT. During this project, not only
                        did I overcome sleep, but I also learned how to effectively
                        work in a team and the importance of planning a project 
                        before starting.

                        A platformer game created using the godot game engine
                        with scripts written in godot's python inspired
                        language. Besides basic game, level, and art design, 
                        I also learned to overcome a multitude of scripting
                        problems. This was a passion project of mine.
                        Where I completely created a game, from it's art to the 
                        programing behind it.
